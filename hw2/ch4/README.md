__Long hand vs Short hand__

    One advantage of using long hand is that it can be easier for you to remember what your commands are doing. 
    One advantage of using shorthand is that you can chain multiple together easier.
    Long hand 2 dashes 
    Short hand 1 dash

__Concepts__

    Instead of trying to remember everything, instead remember you can easily look stuff up in the man pages
