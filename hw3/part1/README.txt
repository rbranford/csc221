Your lab directory is: C:\Users\Owner\desktop\belhavencs\csc221\hw3

Inside your lab directory, you must create these directories:

 allentando
 antiparallelogram
 claddings
 electrothermostatic
 inquilinous
 monomaniacs
 quisquilious
 skewing
 superfructified
 swiften

For example:

$ cd C:\Users\Owner\desktop\belhavencs\csc221\hw3
$ mkdir allentando

These directories are random words chosen based on your username.

Each file in your lab directory (e.g. file00008) contains a list of
random words, but each one contains one instance of each of the random
words you used to create your directories.

Each file must be placed in the directory whose name is contained in
the file.

E.g. if the word "allentando" is in the file "file00008", then you must move
that file "file00008" into the directory "allentando".

$ cd C:\Users\Owner\desktop\belhavencs\csc221\hw3
$ mv file00008 allentando
